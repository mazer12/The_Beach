A project made in Directx11 3D to showcase procedural generation techniques and post-processing. Made as part of University coursework. 

#Controls
1) WASD to see left/right/bottom/top.
2) Space bar to move forward and Tab or Right click to move backwards.
3) G to generate the terrain.
4) Hold V to enable smoothing.
5) Hold 'F1' to enable the Blur effect.
6) Hold 'F2' to enable the Swirling effect.
 
The scene starts with a beach scene. Set the parameters in Terrain Menu in ImGui and press G, to see the mountain terrain grow. Increase the smoothing value from 0, and hold V to smooth the mountain surface.

Note: The water initializes as seen and does not change with any controls.
